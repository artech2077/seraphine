# Epics & User Stories

## Epic 0 – Project Access & Foundations
Stand up the infrastructure, repositories, and shared knowledge needed to collaborate.

### Story 0.1 GitHub & Vercel Project Bootstrap
- Establish the GitHub repository with branch protections and default CODEOWNERS.
- Link the repo to a Vercel project using the autogenerated Vercel domain (no custom domain).
- Configure GitHub Actions CI pipeline to run lint, unit tests, and Playwright smoke checks on every pull request.

### Story 0.2 Vendor Credential Intake & Secrets Distribution
- Create `docs/ops/vendor-owners.md` listing human contacts and escalation paths for GitHub, Vercel, Clerk, Convex, and n8n.
- Document required credentials, scopes, and storage locations in a shared intake checklist; confirm delivery through 1Password/Doppler.
- Verify access by running `pnpm dlx vercel whoami`, `npx convex list`, Clerk API ping, and n8n workflow test using the provided secrets.

### Story 0.3 Developer Onboarding Playbook
- Produce `docs/ops/onboarding.md` with hardware/software prerequisites, install steps, and troubleshooting tips.
- Include scripts or commands to seed Convex with sample catalog and AI insight data for local development.
- Ensure at least two team members follow the guide end-to-end and record completion notes.

## Epic 1 – Application Skeleton & Authentication
Create the core application structure, authentication, and UI shell.

### Story 1.1 Next.js + Convex Baseline
- Initialize a Next.js 14 app with pnpm, ESLint, and TypeScript configured.
- Connect Convex client/server, including schemas for products, sales events, AI insights, and feedback notes.
- Implement lint and unit test suites with sample tests for Convex actions and React components.

### Story 1.2 Clerk Authentication Integration
- Configure Clerk for the project, including French-localized sign-in/up flows.
- Add middleware to gate all app routes behind authentication and map Clerk user roles to app roles stored in Convex.
- Provide a seed script that creates an Owner and Pilot Tester account for development.

### Story 1.3 UI Shell with Tailwind & shadcn/ui
- Set up Tailwind with Seraphine tokens and integrate shadcn/ui components (layout shell, navigation rail, button, card, table).
- Implement responsive layout with primary navigation for Dashboard, POS, Sales Log, and Settings.
- Add light/dark themes and French-first copy placeholders for key UI elements.

### Story 1.4 Observability & Health Checks
- Add structured logging with request IDs for API routes and Convex actions.
- Expose `/api/healthz` returning app version, environment, and Convex connectivity status.
- Configure Vercel monitoring alerts for failed deploy hooks and health check regressions.

## Epic 2 – Internal Data & AI Insights
Surface enriched data produced by the n8n workflow to support decision-making.

### Story 2.1 n8n Workflow Integration
- Define the n8n workflow contract (input data sources, transformation steps, output schema).
- Schedule or manually trigger the workflow to inject AI insight records into the dedicated Convex collection.
- Add validation to ensure malformed records are quarantined and surfaced via admin notifications.

### Story 2.2 Dashboard Insight Cards
- Build Dashboard cards for cash variance, top-selling products, and attention alerts using data from Convex.
- Provide time range filters (today, last 7 days) and status badges indicating freshness of n8n data.
- Include empty/error states when no insights are available or workflow failures occur.

### Story 2.3 Lightweight Reports & Exports
- Generate downloadable CSV summary of daily sales, cash variance, and AI recommendations.
- Offer quick-print PDF with the same content for leadership review.
- Track report generation events in Convex for auditing.

## Epic 3 – POS Barcode Pilot
Empower internal testers to record sales rapidly and review outcomes.

### Story 3.1 Product Catalog & Barcode Registry
- CRUD interface for catalog items with barcode, name, price, tax, and optional notes.
- Import helper for CSV template to bulk load pilot catalog data.
- Detect duplicate barcodes and surface conflict resolution UI.

### Story 3.2 Barcode Sale Capture
- POS screen listens for USB/wedge barcode scanners and provides manual search fallback.
- Capture item quantity, line total, and tender method; allow voids with confirmation.
- Persist sales events to Convex and update the dashboard in real time.

### Story 3.3 Daily Sales Log & Reconciliation Snapshot
- Present a chronological sales log with filters for user, tender type, and variance flags.
- Compute daily totals (gross sales, refunds, cash expected) and display them alongside manual override inputs.
- Export the log to CSV/PDF alongside operator notes.

## Epic 4 – Pilot Feedback & Continuous Improvement
Collect insights from internal testers and close the loop.

### Story 4.1 In-App Feedback Submission
- Provide contextual feedback entry points on Dashboard and POS screens with quick-tagging (bug, idea, confusion).
- Store submissions in Convex with user, timestamp, and screen metadata.
- Send summary notifications to the product team (email or Slack webhook).

### Story 4.2 Pilot Analytics & Review Ritual
- Create a simple internal view aggregating usage stats (logins, scans per day, report downloads) and feedback tags.
- Schedule a recurring review meeting with notes captured in `docs/pilot/retro.md`.
- Document criteria for graduating features from pilot to production roadmap.
